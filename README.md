# EMACS

This is my emacs config. If you are using this, you probably shouldn't be - I don't know what I'm doing. At the time of writing, I'm mainly using this for org-mode and markdown. For web programming, I recommend this [purcell's config](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d).

For a fresh install on a new machine run `M-x package-install-selected-packages` to download packages not in the repo.
